      Detects Snyk GitHub App scans on pull requests by querying GitHub
      commit status API. Waits for scan completion and captures results.
      Categorizes by scan type (Open Source, Code, Container, IaC).

      Proves Snyk is running on PRs by querying Lunar Hub for Snyk data
      from recent PRs. Used on the default branch to provide compliance proof
      that PR scanning is happening (since Snyk GitHub App only posts checks
      on PRs, not directly on the default branch).

      Detects Snyk CLI executions in CI pipelines. Captures the command
      and exit code, then categorizes by subcommand (test, code, container, iac).
